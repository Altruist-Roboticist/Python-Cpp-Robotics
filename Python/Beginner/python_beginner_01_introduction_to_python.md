# Introduction to Python

Python is a versatile and easy-to-learn programming language that is widely used in various fields, including robotics. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of Python and help you get started with writing your first Python program.

## Why Python for Robotics?

Python is a popular choice for robotics due to its simplicity and readability. It has a large community and a wealth of libraries that make it easy to interface with hardware, control robots, and process data.

## Installing Python

Before we can start programming in Python, we need to install it on our computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

Follow the installation instructions for your operating system. Make sure to add Python to your system's PATH during the installation process.

## Writing Your First Python Program

Let's write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.

1. Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice.
2. Type the following code:

    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```

3. Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `hello_world.py`.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
5. Run the program by typing:

    ```bash
    python hello_world.py
    ```

You should see the output:

```
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You've just written and executed your first Python program.
